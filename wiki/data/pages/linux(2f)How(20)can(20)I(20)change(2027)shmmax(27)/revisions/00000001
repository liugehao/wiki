How can I change 'shmmax'

    I have installed Oracle 9i on RedHat 9.

    Current value of 'shmmax' is 33554432.

    Some people recommend value of appr. 50% of the RAM.

    I tried to change the value of 'shmmax' in two ways:
{{{
    1. cat 268435456 > /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax
    2. sysctl -w kernel.shmmax=268435456
}}}
    After restarting the machine the value of 'shmmax' is 33554432 again ?!?

As root I edited '''/etc/sysctl.conf''' by adding following line at the end of the file:
{{{
kernel.shmmax = 268435456
}}}
After rebooting the machine I found the same value (268435456) in /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax

So, I guess the things go as follows:

"/proc/sys/kernel/shmmax" reads the value from the "/etc/sysctl.conf"

If there's nothing about SHMMAX excplicitly in "/etc/sysctl.conf" then I guess "/proc/sys/kernel/shmmax" accepts the 33554432 which could be the default, I suppose.

That's Ok.
